# Overview
Welcome to the overview of today's code and what the purpose of it. 

The software I wrote is a text-based adventure game titled "Choose Your Own Adventure: Hunted Forest." The game is implemented in Python and follows a narrative structure where the player makes choices at various points, leading to different branches in the story. The game is organized into different sections, each represented by functions, creating a modular and readable structure.

The purpose of this software is to provide an interactive and engaging text-based adventure game experience. It serves as a creative and entertaining way for users to explore a haunted forest, make decisions that impact the narrative, and discover different outcomes based on their choices. The inclusion of multiple story branches, dynamic storytelling, and replayability adds depth to the gaming experience, encouraging users to explore different paths and endings. Overall, the software is designed for entertainment, storytelling, and user interaction in a game setting.

# Development Environment
Here are the tools that was use for my software and what each of them are and how they work.

### GitHub
>GitHub is a place where programmers store, share, and collaborate on their code, making it easier to work on big projects together and keep track of all the changes. It's like a big, organized playground for building digital stuff.

- Why I used it: to share my code and save it which helped keep track of my changes and show me when I did each change. It also allows me to share it so others like you can look at it.

### Visual Studio Code 
>Visual Studio Code is friendly, free, and smart computer program that makes writing and working with code easier, whether you're building websites, apps, games, or anything else that uses computer languages. It's like having a helpful assistant by your side as you explore the world of coding.

- Why I used it: I used this to create and run my software.

# Useful Websites
Down below are websites that I used to help learn and better my understanding of python and further that knowledge and it might help you if you want to learn the language too

- [w3schools (Python Intro)](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_intro.asp)

- [makeuseof (Python Text Adventure Game Create)](https://www.makeuseof.com/python-text-adventure-game-create/)

*Note: The last website I used only to help give me ideas on how to lay it out. I didn't used the actually code the website provided*

# Future Work
Here is some things that I could have added or even improve to make the software more advance

- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling where necessary, especially when dealing with file I/O, user inputs, or any external dependencies.

- **Consistent Formatting** : Ensure consistent formatting for the printed messages. Some messages have extra spaces, and maintaining a consistent format enhances readability.

- **Exit Function** : The exit function is used as a value in the next_function assignment. Instead, I could have used sys.exit() or another method to exit the program.
